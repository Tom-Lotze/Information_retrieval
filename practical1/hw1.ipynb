    "    - The naive version of tf-idf does not take into account the document length, which might become problematic if some of the documents become very long (e.g. books), since the query terms are more likely to appear more often in those long documents. Furthermore, if the query term does not occur in any of the documents, we encounter divisions by 0.  \n",
